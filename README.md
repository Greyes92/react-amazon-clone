# PROJECT GAME ON

Welcome! My name is Gibran Reyes. I am a transitioning Service Member that recently separated from the US ARMY and an aspiring Full Stack Software Engineer. I am currently attending The Operation Level Up Software Engineering Immersive/Bootcamp through Galvanize. This a project I am working on for the course and is my first Full Stack Application with CRUD functionality. It still needs a lot of work and I will continue to add more features as my knowledge and skills grow throughout the course. Game on is a video game search that utilizes and fetches data from the RAWG.IO api. I designed, styled, coded, and deployed the full application. Thank you for stopping by and checking my project out! Below I have broken down my project.

### Languages And Tools Used:
**Front End**
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS

**Back End**
- Node.js
- Express.js

**Database**
- PostgreSQL

### Feature 1: Search
The main feature of Game On is the search function. You may search for a game using the search bar at the top of the page. It populate the top 20 most relevant results. In the future, I plan to add a sort/filter function and also more pages that you can look through. User's have the option to add a game to their wishlist.

### Feature 2: Users
As of now, I do not have proper authentication as I am still learning how to properly and securely implement that into my project. Currently, Game On can create, delete and update users and store that information in a database. 

### Feature 3: Wishlist
After a user has created an account, they can add any game to their wishlist. Since proper authentication is not set up yet, a prompt will appear asking for a username to know which user's wishlist will add the game after the "Add To Wishlist" button has been pressed. In order to see their wishlist the user will have click to the "Wishlist" button and another prompt will appear asking for a username to know which user data will be populated. Once a game is in a user's wishlist, they can delete it.

### Feature 4: Upcoming Releases
The "Upcoming Releases" Button will show what games will be releasing within the next year. Users have the option to add a game to their wishlist.


### Feature 5: Latest Releases
The "Latest Releases" Button will show games that have released within the last 3 months. Users have the option to add a game to their wishlist.

### In the future I would like to add:
- Proper User authentication
- Filter/sort results
- Pages to display more results
- Links that users can follow to the desired games' store
- Game Trailers and screenshots
- Possibly a comments section
