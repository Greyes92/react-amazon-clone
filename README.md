# Amazon Clone

Welcome! My name is Gibran Reyes and this is my Amazon Clone. In this build I tried to challenge myself by recreating the Amazon webpage using React. While building this clone I gained a much better understanding of React, React Hooks, React Router, functional-based components, styled components, and JavaScript. My CSS definitely improved with this build as well. As of now there are two main features that work which are the Search Feature and the Shopping Cart. The Amazon logo will bring you back to the homepage and the shopping cart icon will take you to the shopping cart page. You can click on sign in and will it take you to the sign in page but I have not added a users feature yet. This is a work in progress and I will continue to add more features in the future.

### Feature 1: Search
You have the ability to search for products using the Search Bar located on the Header. All items are dynamically rendered based on your search query and data is provided by the Scale Serp API which pulls it's data from Google Shopping. When clicking on the search icon it will bring you to the results page where you may make another query.

### Feature 2: Add To Cart
Any items that have an add to cart button may be added to your shopping cart. By clicking on the shopping cart icon on the header, it will take you to the shopping cart page. The numbers next to the shopping cart icon will dynamically change depending how many items are in the cart. In the shopping cart page you may change the quantity of the items which will then dynamically change the subtotal as well as the price of the specific item. Currently, there is no check out feature.


### In the future I would like to add:
- Proper User authentication though Google or email/password
- Filter/sort results
- Pages to display more results
- Checkout
- Full product pages
- Possible DB switch to PostgreSQL
